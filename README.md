### API

OpenSpin runs a simple HTTP server which allows you to remotely control the application.
Server responses are given in JSON format.

```
# Payload :
http://SERVER_IP:55670/status
# Response :
{"http": {"code": 200}, "application": {"name": "Open-Source Emulators Frontend", "version": "1.0", ...}, ...} // if the application is currently running a game, this game's metadata will be given here.

# Payload :
http://SERVER_IP:55670/play?game=GAME_NAME&system=SYSTEM_NAME
# Response :
{"http": {"code": 200}, "game": {"name": "GAME_NAME", "version": "GAME_VERSION", ...}, ...} // the response gives all available metadata from the application game database.

# Payload :
http://SERVER_IP:55670/quit
# Response :
{"http": {"code": 200}} // if response is not 200, the application can't quit
```

## Dependencies

### Main

* [libsdl2-dev](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* cmake
* make

### For toolchain

Just install known dependencies for your toolchain (android-sdk and ndk for Android toolchain, mingw32 for window toolchain, etc...) 

## Build

**NB :** You need to use xCode to build for iOS and OSX.

### Simple steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbltx/OpenSpin.git
cd OpenSpin
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
```

### Cmake toolchain

```bash
# Android Toolchain (need android SDK API 16 and android ndk added in PATH)
cmake \
	-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/android.cmake ../
cd OpenSpin/jni/src && ndk-build

# iOS Toolchain (real device)
cmake \
	-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/iOS.cmake \
	-DIOS_PLATFORM=OS \
	-DCMAKE_IOS_SDK_ROOT="$(xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-path)" \
	-GXcode ../
xcodebuild -sdk iphoneos

# iOS Toolchain (Simulator)
cmake \
	-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/iOS.cmake \
	-DIOS_PLATFORM=SIMULATOR \
	â€“DCMAKE_IOS_SDK_ROOT="$(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path)" \
	-GXcode ../
xcodebuild -sdk iphonesimulator
xcrun instruments -w "iPhone 6 (8.3 Simulator)"
xcrun simctl install booted {PATH_TO_YOUR_.APP_FILE}
```
